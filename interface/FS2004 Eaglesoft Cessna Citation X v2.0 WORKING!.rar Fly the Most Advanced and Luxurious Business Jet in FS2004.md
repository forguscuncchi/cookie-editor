## Setting Up the Flight Plan
 
The first step to fly the Eaglesoft Cessna Citation X v2.0 is to create a flight plan in FS2004. You can use the default flight planner or any other tool that you prefer. Once you have your flight plan ready, you need to load it into the Citation's flight management system (FMS).
 
To do this, you need to open the FMS panel by pressing Shift+3 on your keyboard. Then, you need to click on the FPL button on the left side of the FMS screen. This will bring up the flight plan page, where you can see your departure and arrival airports and your waypoints.
 
To load your flight plan from FS2004 into the FMS, you need to click on the MENU button on the right side of the FMS screen. This will bring up a menu with several options. You need to select LOAD FROM GPS and then click on EXECUTE. This will import your flight plan from FS2004 into the FMS.
 
Once you have loaded your flight plan, you need to set the speed and altitude for each waypoint. To do this, you need to click on each waypoint on the FMS screen and enter the desired speed and altitude in knots and feet respectively. For example, if you want to fly at 250 knots and 10,000 feet at a certain waypoint, you need to enter 250/10000 in the scratchpad and then click on EXECUTE.

After you have set the speed and altitude for each waypoint, you need to initialize the FMS by clicking on INIT REF on the left side of the FMS screen. This will bring up a page where you need to enter some information about your flight, such as departure runway, wind speed and direction, fuel load, etc. You can find this information in FS2004 or use realistic values based on your preferences.
 
## Taking Off
 
Once you have initialized the FMS, you are ready to take off. To do this, you need to select the correct flight guidance controller (FGC) source by clicking on either FGC1 or FGC2 on the glareshield panel above the main instruments. This will determine which FGC will control your autopilot and flight director.
 
Then, you need to enter your V speeds (takeoff speeds) by clicking on V SPEEDS on the left side of the FMS screen. This will bring up a page where you can see your V1 (decision speed), VR (rotation speed), and V2 (takeoff safety speed) calculated by the FMS based on your weight and runway conditions. You can accept these values or enter your own if you wish.
 
Next, you need to select NAV and C/O (climb out) modes on the glareshield panel by clicking on their respective buttons. This will activate your flight director and tell it to follow your flight plan and climb out profile as programmed in the FMS.
 
Finally, you need to set an initial altitude on the altitude selector knob on the glareshield panel by rotating it with your mouse wheel or clicking on it with your mouse cursor. This will be your target altitude for your initial climb.
 
Now you are ready to take off. You need to advance your throttles to takeoff power by pressing F3 on your keyboard or dragging them with your mouse cursor. You need to monitor your airspeed and follow your flight

Autocom is a software for diagnostic and programming of cars and trucks. It requires activation before using, which can be done with a file activation.xml and a keygen. Here are the steps to activate Autocom software:
 
1. Download and install Autocom software from the official website or from a trusted source.
2. Run Autocom software and select the interface type (CDP or CDP+).
3. Enter the serial number (100251 for cars or 100253 for trucks) and click OK.
4. A message will appear asking you to activate your product. Click Yes.
5. A window will open where you can browse and select the file activation.xml. If you don't have this file, you need to generate it with a keygen.
6. To generate the file activation.xml, you need to download a keygen that matches your software version (for example, Autocom 2020.23 + no limits keygen + date patch[^1^]).
7. Run the keygen and enter the serial number (100251 for cars or 100253 for trucks) and the hardware key (you can find it in Autocom software under Help -> About).
8. Click Generate FileActivation.xml and save it to your desktop.
9. Go back to Autocom software and select the file activation.xml that you just generated.
10. A message will appear confirming that your product is activated. Click OK.
11. Enjoy using Autocom software!

Note: Some keygens may require changing the date on your computer or running a patch before generating the file activation.xml. Please follow the instructions provided with the keygen carefully.
